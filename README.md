## 📊 Datasets  

The following datasets are used in the analysis:  

- **dollar.txt** – Exchange rate data  
- **CO2.txt** – Atmospheric CO2 levels  
- and more  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  

The analysis is performed in **R** using the following libraries:  

- `forecast` – Time series forecasting models  
- `ggplot2` – Data visualization  
- `tseries` – Statistical tests for time series  
- `xts` – Handling time-indexed data  

## 📈 Assignments & Analysis  

Each assignment explores different aspects of time series analysis, including:  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding trends, seasonality, and stationarity.  
2. **ARIMA Modeling** – Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average models for forecasting.  
3. **Decomposition Techniques** – Breaking down time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.  
4. **Exponential Smoothing** – Techniques like Holt-Winters method for trend and seasonality.  
5. **Long-term Forecasting** – Using different models to predict future trends.
